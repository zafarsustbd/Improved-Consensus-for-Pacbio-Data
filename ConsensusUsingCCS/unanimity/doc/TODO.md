 * models compiled into separate static lib for -Wl,-whole-archive-ness
 * more comments and documentation overall
 * merge Mono-/Multi-MolecularIntegrators, use map of (SNRs + Models) -> Template
 * template-ify Evaluator, Template for ModelConfig, get rid of unique_ptr-ing, EvaluatorFactory
 * SparsePoa isn't actually sparse, makeAlignmentColumn isn't using the provided beginRow/endRow
 * Add more random tests of assumed invariants (e.g. mutating each position of a homopolymer should be identical)
